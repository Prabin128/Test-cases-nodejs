/*
                                        Stubs function in Sinon

 1. With the stub() function, you can swap out a function for a fake version of that function with pre-determined behavior. 
    This is helpful for testing edge cases, like what happens when an HTTP request fails.
 2. Thereâ€™re times when you wanted to test a function that has dependencies. 
    You would stub those dependencies out to force your code into some specific path.
